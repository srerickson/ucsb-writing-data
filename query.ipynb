Three central appeals discussed in rhetoric, established by the philosopher Aristotle are logos, ethos, and pathos.  These three appeals are all treated as integral parts of rhetoric, and a given author may combine all three of them to convince their audience."

We then had to identify the pathos, logos, and ethos of the texts. In addition, in my AP European History class, we would read written accounts almost everyday, analyzing stating its historical value and deducing cause and effect. These experiences I believe have prepared me for successfully completing assignments like Rhetorical Analysis as I have learned the importance of the role of context in important speeches and texts in my classes.

In my English Abitur I analyzed a critical evaluation by an author who discussed the purpose and history of Wikipedia and also expressed his opinions regarding strengths but also potential problems of the sites usage.

The analysis had to include a thesis regarding how effectively the author argued their point and textual evidence to support the thesis.
