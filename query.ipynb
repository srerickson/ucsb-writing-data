       "I would relate most to the \"Gender Stereotypes and Learning Approaches in Computer Science\" by Chanchan Mao. In high school, I was a cheerleader. Whenever we would have tryouts or open gym I would be shocked to see that no boys were trying out. I talked to a couple of my male friends and asked if they knew why no males were trying out. They responded that it was a \"female-only activity\". This angered me I would consider periods or giving birth to be considered female-only activities, not sports. Yes, there are sports dedicated to a specific gender, such as women's volleyball or boys' basketball. But there are all sports that aren't specific at all such as football or cheerleading. Eventually, one day a boy Thomas decided to show up for the open gym and talk to him as to why he finally began to show up. He said he was intimated by a sport that was dominated by main women and would feel outcasted from the rest of the team. As a female who has stuck to sports dedicated to my gender, I could feel what Thomas was"

During my gender studies course I was given the task to listen to any gender-related podcast and write an opinionated response. Being interested in sports and intruiged by transgender rights, I listened to podcasts about the controversy around transgender athletes. Should female athletes who were born as male be allowed to participate in female competitions? As of today, many states are stripping transgender athletes of the right to particiapte in any sports competition due to an unfair advantage. The simple act of playing a sport is one of the only activities nowadays that brings people together - no matter your beleifs. Sports have always been a prominent aspect of my life and at a certain age I truly believed it would be my profession.

The class was all about coming to end conclusions on various research questions that I would construct.

Outside of the classroom, certain encounters and life experiences have also prepared me to question things on a day to day basis.

Last year, I was able to choose a topic from over twenty controversial ideas that ranged from should uniforms be an enforced school policy to the effectiveness of honors/AP classes. I chose to explore the ideas of professional sports and the difference between the compensation men and women receive. I spent about a week researching professional athletes and sports reporters as well as reviewing the statistics over the years of payment received by players. I chose to focus on the issue that women are paid far less than men solely based on tradition and sexism. I pointed out that stereotypes assume men are far more successful than women, but these ideas are wrong. For example, Serena Williams has won more Grand Slams than any other tennis player ever, yet male tennis players gain over two times the amount with even less success. I"

Although I have responded to scholarly topics I believe that I would have a bit of a hard time applying a rhetorical approach to the reading and responding to it with my own personal research. Previous experiences in the classroom such as extensive research projects, and argumentative essays have given me a familiar presence around writing samples, such as the ones provided. Conducting research on why women sports are less popularized has helped familiarize myself with voicing my opinion to reflect on the misconceptions of why toxic misogynic affects the viewing of these women sports. This task has helped me understand the idea of pursuing an interest in a topic, and understand why their are many taboos regarding a sport. "
