My journey to join the golf team provides me with the life context, and the reading in school provides me with the academic experience of \"How to Read Like a Writer\" and \"understanding Genre in a rhetorical system.\" As a golfer, much like any other athlete, I would watch many highlights and documentaries of great players like Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson, trying to figure out the underlying reason behind the type of shot and the choices they would make. Why do they usually hit the ball high in the United States while keeping it under the howling wind on the British links?

I related this situation to my identity today because it taught me to not be intimidated by individuals who are more powerful than I am.
