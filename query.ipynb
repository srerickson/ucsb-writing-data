These are all key aspects in determining and evaluating how and why the speaker intends to reach his/her goal. I know the assignment would entitle a substantial use of commentary along with identifying and analyzing the author's use of rhetoric. The Genre Translation assignment however, was much more confusing. I have some experience with research papers and overall synthesis writing but it's not as evident as the Rhetorical Analysis assignment. "

One memorable instance was when my class did a rhetorical analysis of Narrative of the Life of Fredrick Douglass. That was the first time I was introduced to rhetorical analysis. I was instructed to select a passage and to write a brief paragraph about the author's message, intended audience, context, and rhetoric used. This was all to be achieved with clarity through a strong claim and supporting evidence. Many of my following assignments relating to rhetorical analysis developed my ability to analyze passages as well as constructing my own reflections. "

We then had to identify the pathos, logos, and ethos of the texts. In addition, in my AP European History class, we would read written accounts almost everyday, analyzing stating its historical value and deducing cause and effect. These experiences I believe have prepared me for successfully completing assignments like Rhetorical Analysis as I have learned the importance of the role of context in important speeches and texts in my classes. Furthermore, the Response essay wants the student to relate a read world issue to themselves in an argumentative essay. Throughout school I have written many argumentative essays, on"
