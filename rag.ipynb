       "The student's writings compared to the writing I have done in the past are somewhat alike because I can write long essays. I am just not used to it, I write them every once and awhile. My experience with writing has prepared me for what's to come in college writing but it definitely hasn't prepared me to consistently write on that level. I've written at most 3 page papers but I never actually knew what I was doing. I would continue to write whatever I thought was best and if I answered the essay prompt then I was done. College writing will definitely be more tedious but I plan to expand my writing skills through class and tutors.\n",

I believe that starting with Writing 2 will allow me to direct more focus towards understanding and utilizing new concepts in college writing, rather than just reviewing and improving my existing skills.\n",

       "I have taken two college level writing courses, in addition to CSU expository reading and writing while in high school. My understanding and practice with college writing courses, I believe, is at the level in which I can comfortably take writing 2. Writing 1, while it may offer some help, would be no more than busy work for me.Â \n",
