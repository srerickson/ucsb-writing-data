       "As a student without excessively outstanding performance in reading and writing, even though I had experienced and possessed a certain amount of writing skills and genres throughout high school, most of the writing courses I took weren‚Äôt college-level. As a student who completed just ordinary high school English classes, I presume a transition time to acquire and master more techniques for college writing courses is essential. Therefore, I believe Writing 1 would be the best fit as a bridge of boarding scholastic writing, and being well trained for this challenge I still need to overcome.\n",
       "\n",
       "The student's writings compared to the writing I have done in the past are somewhat alike because I can write long essays. I am just not used to it, I write them every once and awhile. My experience with writing has prepared me for what's to come in college writing but it definitely hasn't prepared me to consistently write on that level. I've written at most 3 page papers but I never actually knew what I was doing. I would continue to write whatever I thought was best and if I answered the essay prompt then I was done. College writing will definitely be more tedious but I plan to expand my writing skills through class and tutors.\n",
       "\n",
       "Like Writing 1 Student 1, I graduated from a fairly small high school and I expect the transition to college level classes to be somewhat challenging. In high school, I also took two years of independent study English classes that, while being necessary for my situation at the time, did not fully prepare me for a class like Writing 2. I think that being in Writing 1 will help me comfortably assimilate into the mindset that college demands.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the past 2 years, I haven't done too much educational, informative writing in my English class. We've mostly done analysis on news articles/short stories and learned about/applied critical theories. Writing 1 feels more comfortable as it'll help me adjust to writing for a grade once again. My reading comprehension and writing are also not the strongest, so I want to sharpen that skill. As I'm adapting to college, I'm also adapting to all the different people here on campus. Same goes for my writing- many have different experiences and ways they write their pieces so I would like to experience that too, compare it to mine, learn, and enhance my writing from there. Writing 2 focuses on effectively evaluating texts in a deeper sense, and applying more technical aspects of writing and understanding the writer of which is something I think I still need to hone. As of now, Writing 1 seems to be a more comfortable gradual transition from high school writing to college level writing. \n",
       "\n",
       "Actually seeing college level writing has shown me that I'm not too comfortable with all of it yet. It does look perplexing but doesn't look like anything too far out of my reach. I think taking Writing 1 would better suit my current level and understanding of college level writing."
